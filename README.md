## Features

### üîç Comprehensive Cluster Visibility
- **Real-time monitoring** of nodes, pods, deployments, and services
- **Dynamic network topology visualization** showing infrastructure connections
- **Resource utilization metrics** for CPU, memory, storage, and network
- **Service mesh visualization** for microservices architecture

### üöÄ DevOps & CI/CD Integration
- **GitLab CI/CD pipeline integration** for continuous deployment visualization
- **Deployment tracking** with status monitoring and rollback capabilities
- **Canary and blue-green deployment** support with traffic steering

### üîí Security & Compliance
- **Network policy visualization** to understand security boundaries
- **Real-time security alerts** for policy violations and potential threats
- **Compliance monitoring** for industry standards and custom policies

### ‚öôÔ∏è Resource Optimization
- **Cost optimization recommendations** based on actual resource usage
- **Automated scaling suggestions** to improve resource utilization
- **Performance bottleneck detection** with actionable improvements

### üîî Monitoring & Alerts
- **Real-time alerts** for cluster and application issues
- **Customizable dashboards** for different stakeholders
- **Historical data analysis** for trend identification and capacity planning

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React** with TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience
- **TailwindCSS** with shadcn/ui components for a modern, responsive UI
- **Recharts & D3.js** for interactive data visualizations
- **WebSockets** for real-time updates from the Kubernetes clusters

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express for API services
- **WebSockets** for real-time communication with the frontend
- **Kubernetes API** integration for cluster management

### Infrastructure
- **Kubernetes** as the target platform for management
- **Istio/Calico** for service mesh and network policy visualization
- **Prometheus & Grafana** data sources for metrics and monitoring

## Architecture

KubeOrchestrator follows a modern, microservices-based architecture:

1. **Frontend Layer** - React-based SPA that communicates with the backend API
2. **API Layer** - RESTful API services for data retrieval and management actions
3. **WebSocket Layer** - Real-time communication channel for live updates
4. **Integration Layer** - Connectors to Kubernetes API, CI/CD systems, and monitoring tools
5. **Storage Layer** - Persistence for user preferences, historical data, and configurations

## Real-World Applications

KubeOrchestrator addresses critical challenges faced by organizations running Kubernetes in production:

1. **Operational Visibility** - Provides a unified view of complex Kubernetes environments, reducing time to identify issues
2. **Cost Management** - Identifies underutilized resources and provides optimization recommendations, reducing cloud spending
3. **Security Enforcement** - Visualizes and enforces network policies, preventing security breaches
4. **DevOps Acceleration** - Streamlines deployment workflows and provides visibility into CI/CD pipelines
5. **Cross-team Collaboration** - Unified dashboard for developers, operations, and security teams

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster (local or remote)
- Kubernetes configuration file with appropriate permissions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kubeorchestrator.git
   cd kubeorchestrator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure your environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Access the application at http://localhost:5000

### Connecting to Your Cluster

1. Ensure your Kubernetes config file is properly set up
2. Navigate to "Add Cluster" in the dashboard
3. Provide cluster access details (endpoint, credentials, etc.)
4. The dashboard will automatically connect and begin displaying data

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t kubeorchestrator:latest .

# Run the container
docker run -p 5000:5000 -v ~/.kube:/app/.kube kubeorchestrator:latest
```

### Kubernetes Deployment
```bash
# Apply the deployment configuration
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml

# Expose the service
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
```

## Roadmap

- **Multi-cluster federation** management
- **Machine learning-based** anomaly detection and predictive scaling
- **Gitops workflow** integration
- **Extended API** for third-party integrations
- **Mobile application** for on-the-go monitoring
